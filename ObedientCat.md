# Obedient Cat

## Overview

Points: 5
Category: General Skills

## Description

This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear"). Download flag.

## Hints

1. Any hints about entering a command into the Terminal (such as the next one), will start with a '$'... everything after the dollar sign will be typed (or copy and pasted) into your Terminal.
2. To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: $ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/704f877da185904ec3992e7255a15c6c/flag
3. $ man cat

## Approach

On PicoCTF, this is the first CTF that I have ever done. It is very basic and intended to provide players with an introduction to basic Linux navigation. It is quite a "bare bones" CTF.

One of the site's first hints is "To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: $ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/704f877da185904ec3992e7255a15c6c/flag".

I wasn't quite sure what wget meant, so I did a quick Google search. Apparently, wget is a computer program that you can use in order to retrieve content and files from web servers. The name is a combination of World Wide Web and the word get.

After running the wget command and downloading the flag, I then printed the flag using the "cat" command.
